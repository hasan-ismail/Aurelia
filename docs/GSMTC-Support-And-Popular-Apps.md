# Global System Media Transport Controls (GSMTC) support and popular media apps

Aurelia' Media Session Controls will support every application that makes use of the [System Media Transport Controls **aka SMTC** API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrols) to manage their media playback.

The built-in Windows Media Flyout will also only support those apps.

Users tend to know which functionalities are supported by Aurelia' Media Sessions Controls for their apps of interest ([#230](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/issues/230) for instance).

## Help us include support for more applications that are currently unsupported

- **VLC** : We have filed a [feature request on VLC's bug tracker site](https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/25258#ticket) asking built-in support for the SMTC APIs for the VLC Desktop (Win32) app.
Hopefully, if enough people request it they might add it. Please check out the ticket.
